The above code makes it so that when you click on a link that redircts to the content on the same page it will leave some gap for the navbar so that when it reaches to the content the navbar does not block it.



      <ul className="nav-links" id="nav-links">
          {pageLinks.map((link) => {
            return (
              <li key={link.id}>
                <a href={link.href} className="nav-link">
                  {' '}
                  {link.text}{' '}
                </a>
              </li>
            );
          })}

When mapping something and always assign the key value to the parent element that is being returned
